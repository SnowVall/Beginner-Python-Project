The BMW M3 is a high-performance version of the BMW 3 Series,
 developed by BMW's in-house motorsport division, BMW M GmbH.
 M3 models have been produced for every generation of 3 Series since the E30 M3 was introduced in 1986.
 The initial model was available in a coupé body style,
 with a convertible body style made available soon after.
 M3 saloons were offered initially during the E36 and E90 generations.
 Since 2014, the coupé and convertible models have been rebranded as the 4 Series range,
 making the high-performance variant the M4. Variants of the 3 Series since then have seen the M3 produced as a saloon,
 until 2020, when the M3 was produced as an estate for the first time, alongside the saloon variant.
